## 🎯 Motivation

**Your Sofia** is a mobile application for the residents of Sofia. The main motivation is **creating a better living environment through active interaction between citizens and administration**. This project welcomes contributions from developers, designers, and all community members who share the vision of transparent and accessible city services.

### Core Principles

- **Caring for citizens** through information, notifications based on interests and location, inclusion in surveys and voting on city projects
- **Caring for the urban environment** through submitting signals about the state of the urban environment, presenting a map with city objects
- **Caring for efficient city administration** through internal interfaces for easier citizen service, signal processing, and notification management

Guiding Rules:
- **Open Source First**: Every line of code is open for inspection, improvement, and contribution
- **Citizen-Centric**: We prioritize the real needs of city residents
- **Privacy-Respecting**: We don't require personal data for functionalities that can work without them. We don't require registration if we can work with anonymous unique identifiers. For functionalities working with personal data, we encrypt and don't store anything in plain text
- **Bilingual by Design**: Bulgarian is the primary language, with full English support
- **Community-Driven**: Built by the community, for the community
